Phase Change in the Kitchen
===========================

# Notes

I should really write up a more formal procedure. As mentioned below
(and misspelled), I did it with chocolate souffle. The thermo part is
really nice, but the cooking part is a bit sketchy: for a real
souffle, you don't actually want it to complete the phase
transition. Thus, the thought that a custard/flan might work. 

The obvious drawback with custard/flan is that most recipes I know
want you to be a bit gentle with the cooking, often using a water
bath, etc. Those also take longer to cook â€¦ maybe longer than you have
in class. Some quick googling turned up at least one toaster-oven
[recipe](http://toaster-oven.net/recipes/baked-desserts/classic-baked-custard/). I
have to admit, I love having a set of toaster ovens big enough for my
lab. 

If you don't end up using this for a lab, it's really nice to do during a review session.

# Description

I have 7 toaster ovens and 7 digital thermometers (we have 6 lab
stations, and I like to have one extra just in case). 

I did the souffle thing somewhat informally, and haven't written up a
full lab based on it yet. My guess is it'll end up as only part of a
lab, but I'm open to ideas. Here's what I did: 

(1) I made chocolate souffle following the directions at
[Cooking for Engineers](http://www.cookingforengineers.com/recipe/160/Dark-Chocolate-Souffle)
and
brought refrigerated ramekins full of souffle to class. You can use
any recipe, but I know this one tastes good. Two reasons to make it
ahead of time: first, beating egg whites to soft peaks is a pain in
the neck, so I always use a stand mixer, and I only have one of
those. Second, I don't expect many of my students to have enough
experience baking to be able to fold the egg whites into the batter
well, and that's a pretty key step. I was also doing this as part of a
review session. If you have more time, maybe it's fine to have the
students do this part .. it would certainly be more fun. 

(2) Each group gets (at least) two identically prepared souffles. One
of them bakes as per the recipe, and everyone notices that, by the
time it's cooled down enough to eat, it has fallen significantly. For
the other one, you record the temperature on the digital thermometer
every 30-60 seconds. You can clearly see it rise, then level off as
the souffle undergoes a phase transition. As soon as it starts to rise
again, it's time to take the souffle out. Timing is pretty important,
as you'll see that the very top of the souffle is probably slightly
burnt at this point, and it'll get worse quickly. Doing it this way
takes a lot longer than the recipe suggests, may produce a bit of
smoke, and everyone's worried that you've ruined the whole
thing. However, the souffle is delicious and, since it's gone through
the whole phase transition, doesn't fall. 

I only did this during two review sessions, but the results were the
same in both: the recipe version fell quickly, and the physics version
was both scary due to a bit of smoke and delicious. 

My guess as to the timing of most recipes: (1) people actually like
the texture when it hasn't fully gone through the phase transition,
and thus encourage you to eat it quickly before it falls (2) if you
let it go even a little bit past when the temperature starts to tick
up again, things will probably start burning. 

I'm wondering if something like a custard, flan, or creme brulee might
be better in terms of having the recipe timing match up with the end
of the phase transition.
