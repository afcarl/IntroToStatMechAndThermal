Introduction to Statistical Mechanics and Thermal Physics

## Textbook(s) ##

Main textbook: Schroeder's [Introduction to Thermal Physics][Schroeder].
It comes with some supplemental resources, but Schroeder's [blog](http://dvschroeder.blogspot.com/) is interesting and often relevant.

Required supplemental text: Gould and Tobochnik's [Thermal and Statistical Physics][GandT]. Please note that the book is available for free in PDF form both in the previous link and directly on [comPADRE][GandTComp].
